# ACL-Project
To prevent unauthorized access, we’ll set up ACLs so Team 1, working on Website 1, can’t access Website 2, and Team 2, working on Website 2, can’t access Website 1. ACLs will define access rules based on network addresses and user roles to enforce these restrictions and maintain data security.
